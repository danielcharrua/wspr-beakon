CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal

WSPR Beakon Hardware Design
Copyright (c) 2025 Daniel P. EA1REX and Javier B. EB1A

Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among
hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the
freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs
and products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open
Hardware Licence comes in three variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and
two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S
(strongly reciprocal).

The CERN-OHL-S is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in
unmodified form only.

Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any
Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in
their development.

1 Definitions

1.1 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-S.

1.2 'Compatible Licence' means

       a) any earlier version of the CERN Open Hardware licence, or

       b) any version of the CERN-OHL-S, or

       c) any licence which permits You to treat the Source to which
          it applies as licensed under CERN-OHL-S provided that on
          Conveyance of any such Source, or any associated Product You
          treat the Source in question as being licensed under
          CERN-OHL-S.

1.3 'Source' means information such as design files, circuit or circuit
    board layouts, mechanical drawings, flow charts and descriptive
    text, and other information which is explicitly specified as being
    made available under this Licence. The Source may be in any form:
    electronic or printed, graphical or textual. Source need not be in
    a form that is either human readable or understandable, provided
    suitable processing tools are freely available.

1.4 'Covered Source' means Source that is explicitly made available
    under this Licence.

1.5 'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object,
    whether in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use,
    application or processing of Covered Source.

1.6 'Make' means to create or configure something, whether by
    manufacture, assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered
    Source or another Product, or by combinations of these.

1.7 'Available Component' means any part, sub-assembly, library or code
    which:

       a) is licensed to You as Complete Source under a Compatible
          Licence; or

       b) is available, at the time a Product or the Source containing
          it is first Conveyed, to You and any other prospective
          licensees

             i) as a physical part with sufficient rights and
                information (including any configuration and
                programming files and information about its
                characteristics and interfaces) to enable it either to
                be Made itself, or to be sourced and used to Make the
                Product; or
            ii) as part of the normal distribution of a tool used to
                design or Make the Product.

1.8 'Complete Source' means the set of all Source necessary to Make a
    Product, in the preferred form for making modifications, including
    necessary installation and interfacing information both for the
    Product, and for any included Available Components. If the format
    is proprietary, it must also be made available in a format (if the
    proprietary tool can create it) which is viewable with a tool
    available to potential licensees and licensed under a licence
    approved by the Free Software Foundation or the Open Source
    Initiative. Complete Source need not include the Source of any
    Available Component, provided that You include in the Complete
    Source sufficient information to enable a recipient to Make or
    source and use the Available Component to Make the Product.

1.9 'Source Location' means a location where a Licensor has placed
    Covered Source, and which that Licensor reasonably believes will
    remain easily accessible for at least three years for anyone to
    obtain a digital copy.

1.10 'Notice' means copyright, acknowledgement and trademark notices,
     Source Location references, modification notices (subsection 3.3(b))
     and all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of
     warranties that are included in the Covered Source.

1.11 'Licensee' or 'You' means any person exercising rights under this
     Licence.

1.12 'Licensor' means a natural or legal person who creates or modifies
     Covered Source. A person may be a Licensee and a Licensor at the
     same time.

1.13 'Convey' means to communicate to the public or distribute.

2 Applicability

2.1 This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Conveying of
    Covered Source and Products, and the Making of Products. By
    exercising any right granted under this Licence, You irrevocably
    accept these terms and conditions.

2.2 This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to You, and shall
    apply worldwide and without limitation in time.

2.3 You shall not attempt to restrict by contract or otherwise the
    rights granted under this Licence to other Licensees.

2.4 This Licence is not intended to restrict fair use, fair dealing, or
    any other similar right.

3 Copying, Modifying and Conveying Covered Source

3.1 You may copy and Convey verbatim copies of Covered Source, in any
    medium, provided You retain all Notices.

3.2 You may modify Covered Source, other than Notices, provided that You
    irrevocably undertake to make that modified Covered Source available
    from a Source Location should You Convey a Product in circumstances
    where the recipient of the Product reasonably needs access to the
    modified Covered Source to exercise rights under this Licence.

3.3 You may Convey modified Covered Source (other than Notices) provided
    that:

       a) the modified Covered Source is licensed under this Licence; and

       b) You add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that
          You have modified it, with the date and brief description of how
          You modified it.

3.4 You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
    rights granted by this Licence.

4 Making and Conveying Products

You may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You either
provide each recipient of such Products with a copy of Complete Source
or ensure that each recipient of such Products has access to a Source
Location where the same is made available. You must cause any Product You
Make to carry prominent Notices stating it is licensed under this Licence
and indicating where the Complete Source is available. Where it is not
practical for a Product to carry such Notices, You must ensure that such
Notices are easily accessible to anyone acquiring the Product.

5 Research and Development

You may Convey Covered Source, modified Covered Source or Products to
a legal entity carrying out development, testing or quality assurance
work on Your behalf provided that the work is performed on terms which
prevent the entity from both using the Source or Products for its own
commercial activities and Conveying the Source or Products or any
modifications to them to any person other than You. Any modifications
made by the entity shall be deemed to be made by You pursuant to
subsection 3.2.

6 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY

6.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Covered Source and any Products are
    provided 'as is' and any express or implied warranties, including,
    but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, of
    satisfactory quality, non-infringement of third party rights, and
    fitness for a particular purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of
    any Source or Product to the fullest extent permitted by law. The
    Licensor makes no representation that any Source or Product does not
    or will not infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other
    proprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and
    performance of any Source or Product shall be with You and not the
    Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of this
    Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights granted under
    this Licence.

6.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to the
    fullest extent permitted by law, have no liability for direct,
    indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive
    or other damages of any character including, without limitation,
    procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or
    profits, or business interruption, however caused and on any theory
    of contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), product
    liability or otherwise, arising in any way in relation to the
    Covered Source, modified Covered Source and/or the Making or
    Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of the possibility of such
    damages, and You shall hold the Licensor(s) free and harmless from
    any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses, including claims
    by third parties, in relation to such use.

7 Patents

7.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each Licensor
    hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in subsections 7.2 and 8.4)
    patent licence to Make, have Made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
    and otherwise transfer the Covered Source and Products, where such
    licence applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
    Licensor that are necessarily infringed by exercising rights under
    the Covered Source as Conveyed by that Licensor.

7.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered
    Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory patent
    infringement, then any rights granted to You under this Licence for
    the Covered Source or Products shall terminate as of the date such
    litigation is filed.

8 General

8.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become invalid
    or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall
    remain effective.

8.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and
    abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is
    known, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where the
    use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use shall be
    factual and shall not be made in any way that impliedly suggests
    any relationship or endorsement by the Licensor or CERN.

8.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence which
    it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may differ in
    detail to address new problems or concerns. New versions will be
    published with a unique version number and a variant identifier
    specifying the variant. If the Licensor has specified that a given
    variant applies to the Covered Source without specifying a version,
    You may treat that Covered Source as being released under any version
    of the CERN-OHL with that variant. If no variant is specified, the
    Covered Source shall be treated as being released under CERN-OHL-S.
    The Licensor may also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a
    specific version of the CERN-OHL or any later version in which case
    You may apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL with the same
    variant identifier published by CERN.

8.4 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as
    such, and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded.
